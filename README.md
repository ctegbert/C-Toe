# Overview

This project is a C# implementation of a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. It showcases the following key programming concepts:
- Variables and expressions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Classes
- Structures and Unions (demonstrated through nested classes and use of `struct`)
- Inheritance (`abstract` class and `extends`)

I wrote this software to give myself some practical experience working with C#.
